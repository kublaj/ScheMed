  <div class="intro">
    <p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>
I am pleased to introduce to you this healthcare community effort initiated in June 2013, to build an extension to schema.org medical entity (henceforth named health.schema.org). </p>

<p>This effort aimed to enable the use of schema.org not only by webmasters but also in indexing health records, healthcare documents,  and as a pillar open source of medical ontology/vocabulary for formalization of healthcare information.</p>

<p>This effort was inspired by the experience with SALUS EU FP7 project. Within SALUS EU FP7 project- with AGFA Healthcare as a partner,  several reusable clinical entities using  schema.org as a third-party pillar source of medical ontology and have been tested successfully and used.</p>

<p>
This community effort aims to provide a medical/health vocabulary. The intention is not to be complete, or to replace existing clinical information models, or to create a new information model. The aim is mainly to provide most useful and frequently used (so, demand driven) classes and predicates related to the medical domain.</p>

<p> Within this scope all concepts are mapped to the existing terminology (SNOMED, ICD, LOINC, ATC, RxNorm,etc.) as far as it's feasible. The initial proposal have been already submitted to schema.org and anticipatory accepted as an extension but further work is needed for a final submission. Everyone's input is needed here. 
The bigger our community will be, the better the coverage our health schema vocabulary will be.</p>

<p>The current extension is : health.schema.org. Please see the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://demoschemed.appspot.com/MedicalEntity">initial submission under review and restructure</a>.</p>

<p>We will leave out to the consumer the next step of drafting a set of clinical information models using schema.org as a third-party pillar source of medical ontology. This will contribute to the interoperability and re-use of the patterns in healthcare information exchange.</p>
<p>Do not miss this momentum! Please join this effort today and be part of the future healthcare information sharing community!</p>
<p>You're all welcome!</p>

Chair Welcome note
-----------------
<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>
I am pleased to introduce to you this this community effort aims to provide medical,healthcare and life-science specialized web schemas and vocabulary through improving and extending the existing schemas, concepts, terms and definitions in schema.org vocabulary. Ultimate goal is to enable the use of schema.org not only by webmasters but also in indexing health records, healthcare documents, and as a pillar open source of medical and healthcare and life science ontology/vocabulary for formalization of healthcare information. </p>
<p>
This will make healthcare and medical data on web easy to describe correctly (with their correct meaning and context), easy to expose /index so ready to be accessible and will highly improve to re-usability and exchanging in semantic way, with their correct meaning and context. </p>
<p>
The intention is not to replace existing ontologies, nor making upper level ontology nor creating yet another clinical information model/standards. The aim is mainly to provide most useful and frequently used (so, demand driven) classes and properties related to the medical and healthcare domain. Within this scope all concepts are mapped as far as it's feasible to the existing terminology like SNOMED CT, ICD, LOINC, ATC, RxNorm, HL7 FHIR, etc.  </p>
<p>
Initiated in June 2013, it's the technical and functionnal team behind the  extension to schema.org medical entity (henceforth named health-lifesci.schema.org). </p>
The materials here are owned and maintained by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/schemed"> W3C Healthcare Schema Vocabulary Community Group</a>.
 
<p>Everyone's input is needed here. 
The bigger our community will be, the better the coverage our health schema vocabulary will be.</p>
<p>
The history of submitted proposals:</br>

+ v0.2 (September, 2015):  <a href="http://health.sdo-schemedex.appspot.com">The current version </a> - made by the strictly minimum terms, as they were initially in schema.org core. </br>
+ v0.1 (May, 2015):  <a href="http://health.sdo-schemedex-0-1.appspot.com/MedicalEntity">Second submission </a> after review and restructuring.</br>
+ v0.0 (May,2013) <a href="http://demoschemed.appspot.com/MedicalEntity">Initial submission </a> submitted in 2013 for review.</br>

</p>

<p>We will leave out to the consumer the next step of drafting a set of clinical information models using schema.org as a third-party pillar source of medical ontology. This will contribute to the interoperability and re-use of the patterns in healthcare information exchange.</p>
<p>Do not miss this momentum! Please join this effort today and be part of the future healthcare information sharing community!</p>
<p>You're all welcome!</p>

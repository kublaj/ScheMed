Healthcare Schema Vocabulary  (ScheMed)
=================================
Dear colleagues, <br>
I am pleased to introduce to you this **healthcare community effort** initiated in June 2013, to build an axtension to schema.org medical entity (named health.schema.org).<br>
This effort aimed to enable the use of schema.org not only by webmasters but also in indexing health records, healthcare documents and as a pillar open source of medical ontology/vocabulary for formalization of healthcare information. This effort was insipired by the experience with SALUS EU FP7 project (info here: www.salusproject.eu).<br>
Within SALUS EU FP7 project- with AGFA Healthcare as a partner, several reusable clinical entities using schema.org as a third-party pillar source of medical ontology and have been tested successfully and used.<br> This community effort aim to provide a medical/health vocabulary. <br>The intention is not to be complete nor replacing existing clinical information models nor creating a new information model. The aim is mainly to provide most usefull and frequently used (so, demand driven) classes and predicates related to medical domain. Within this scope all concepts are mapped to the existing terminology (SNOMED, ICD, LOINC, ATC, RxNorm,etc.) as far as it’s feasible.<br>

Do not miss this momentum! <br>
Please join this effort today and be part of future healthcare information sharing community!<br><br>

You’re all welcome!<br>
